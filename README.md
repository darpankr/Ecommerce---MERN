Great! Since you’re building an admin dashboard and already have the following tables:

User

Product

Cart

Bag

Let’s structure what a useful and realistic admin dashboard should support. This includes GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations, plus a clean UI to manage them.

✅ Suggested Features for Admin Dashboard
🔹 1. User Management
🔸 UI:
View all users (with name, email, role)

Promote/demote user role (e.g., user ↔ admin)

Delete users

🔸 APIs:
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/app/auth/users	Fetch all users
DELETE	/app/auth/:id	Delete a user
PUT	/app/auth/:id/role	Update user role

🔹 2. Product Management
🔸 UI:
List all products

Add a new product

Edit existing product

Delete product

🔸 APIs:
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/app/products	List all products
POST	/app/products	Add new product
PUT	/app/products/:id	Update product
DELETE	/app/products/:id	Delete product

🔹 3. Bag / Cart Overview (Optional)
These are more for admin insights, not day-to-day management.

🔸 UI:
View user carts (user, product, quantity)

View user bags (user, product, quantity)

🔸 APIs:
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/app/cart/all	Get all cart entries
GET	/app/bag/all	Get all bag entries

⚠️ You may need to build these new routes only for admin use.

🧠 Backend Suggestions
Add an admin middleware (isAdmin) that checks if the authenticated user has the "admin" role before allowing access to admin routes.

Validate body data properly using something like express-validator or manual checks.

Keep logs of delete/update actions (optional but professional).

🧩 UI Dashboard Sections (React)
You can break the dashboard into tabs or cards like:
